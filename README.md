The SCS8UU bearing blocks that came with my acrylic HICTOP
i3 clone were not particularly precise and have bearings
that chatter, leaving artifacts in the print. I bought
two kinds of bronze bearings for smoother movement; [graphite
inserts](https://www.amazon.com/Micromake-Printer-Ultimaker-Graphite-Bearing/dp/B06XV28WHG)
and [oil-impregnated
self-lubricating](https://www.amazon.com/uxcell-Self-lubricating-Bushing-Sleeve-Bearings/dp/B076P9PD2B)
bronze. However, I found that when I mounted them in printed
SCS8UU-style pillow blocks, they were insufficiently aligned and
over-constrained and the print bed did not move smoothly. This design
resolves that by printing one piece for the left side of the bed
where two SCS8UU blocks are normally mounted, and by constraining
only the centers of the individual bushings. The default settings
here are for the 30mm-long bushings, but can be set to other normal
lengths easily.

I used an M4 spiral tap to cut the threads; it clears plastic
out better than a straight flute tap. You can use melt-in inserts
instead, but sufficient alignment may be very hard to maintain,
and the base is thick enough for working plastic threads in my
experience so far.
